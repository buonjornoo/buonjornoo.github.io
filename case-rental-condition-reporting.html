                Our research efforts were able to change the initial product
                idea in a way that would improve user adoption when built. We
                created a product that could be tested in one branch and scaled
                up globally if necessary.

                As externals we need to know everything the client already knows
                about the project, the problem they want to solve and how they
                think they are going to solve it. We facilitated a workshop to
                kick off this project as a team: Product Owner, Service
                Designer, UX Designers, Developer. We mapped the current status
                quo on a journey and identified our research focus. We aligned
                our expectations on what we must, should, could and won’t do
                during the project. Finally we solemnly agreed on how we are
                going to work together and treat each other.

              <p>
                Building an app was the goal of our client since the very
                beginning. We treated this app idea as a hypothesis that we
                would test. We focused our research on understanding the status
                quo to substantiate the business challenge at hand. Besides that
                we examined the assumed user groups and their goals in order to
                create personas we could design for. At the same time we needed
                to investigate the technological status quo of our clients
                branches in order to come up with a realistic solution.

              <p>
                We started our research with interviewing higher level employees
                to get a better understanding of the rental business, how it
                works and the high level processes behind it. We used our
                insights to bring more substance into our workshop journey map.
                The interviews also helped us to plan our semi structured user
                interviews later on.

                We needed to observe the process live at the branches to see how
                they do their job. The main reason behind it is that what users
                actually do is usually different than what they say they do. The
                second reason is that we needed so actually see the environments
                in which the solution would be used. How busy is it? How is the
                lighting? Is there wifi? Is there a network connection at all?
                How much space do they usually have?

              <p>
                After the empathy part to align on our research insights, we
                started ideating on solutions. We narrowed down the solution
                space to the app that was originally committed to by the
                sponsors of our product owner. But now we had enough substance
                to envision how that app would work, what it would do and who
                would use it.

              <h3>Prototype Design</h3>

                Directly after the workshop we transferred the manual sketches
                into the digital space where iterations could directly be
                manipulated and changes would be more easily documented. Our
                initial wireframes were ready in a matter of a few hours. It
                only took a little more effort to turn our wireframes into
                something clickable for our first tests.

                full of participants. The testing scope would be much larger as
                soon as this project would get commitment for development. But
                for this project scope we collectively decided to test in order
                to bring more substance into our click dummy.

                    Our client and the product owner already had ideas about who
                    would use the product. We brought substance to the possible
                    users by using our research data to build personas. This
                    helped us to figure out where to focus our energy on and
                    will help us to empathize when we keep on adding relevant
                    features to the product.

                    We helped the client to figure out what the next steps could
                    look like. It wasn’t only about who would build that product
                    but also who would be able to maintain and scale it. We also
                    helped to plan how to navigate their huge enterprise system,
                    who to talk to, and which stakeholders to keep in mind.
