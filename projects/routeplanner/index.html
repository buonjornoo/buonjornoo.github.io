        <h1>Bikemap Route Planner</h1>
        <section class="my-4">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In the realm of cycling apps, Bikemap encountered a challenge with
            its web-based route planning tools. The "AB-Planner" and "Route
            Editor" offered similar functionalities, leading to user confusion.
            Additionally, both relied on external services, hindering
            innovation. The initiative to create a unified route planner began
            in Q3 2021 and evolved through my roles as both Product Designer and
            Product Manager.
          </p>

          <h2>Project Goals</h2>
          <h3>Business and Innovation</h3>
          <p>
            The primary goal was to break free from an expensive service
            provider, facilitating faster innovation. Simultaneously, we aimed
            to streamline the user experience by offering a single, intuitive
            tool for route creation and editing.
          </p>
          <h3>UX Enhancement</h3>
          <p>
            Reducing user confusion and aligning our web and mobile tools
            visually were key UX objectives. Our strategy involved focusing on
            commuters, addressing the legacy AB Planner's outdated appearance,
            and ensuring cross-platform consistency.

          <h2>Research and Discovery</h2>
          <p>
            Our research delved into technical constraints, user needs, and
            competitive analysis. Key insights included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Third-Party Dependencies:</strong> <br />
              External providers hindered quick innovation, limiting
              customization options.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User Preferences Across Tools:</strong> <br />
              Users of the AB Planner missed features available in the Route
              Editor, and vice versa.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Outdated AB Planner Perception:</strong> <br />
              The AB Planner's appearance led users to perceive the map data as
              outdated, affecting trust.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Geocoding Challenges:</strong> <br />
              Users faced issues with the inflexible geocoder, preferring the
              superior experience of tools like Google Maps.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Map Style Discrepancies:</strong> <br />
              Users missed map styles from mobile apps in the legacy AB Planner,
              causing inconsistency.
            </li>

          <h2>Target Audience</h2>

          <p>
            We know that only a small, but very engaged, part of our user base
            is using the Web Route Planners frequently. Most of them use the
            Route Editor since the legacy AB Planner has much more options on
            the mobile app than the Web Version. Generally speaking, we found
            that most users who use the legacy AB Planner, are people who enjoy
            long tours. Some even plan routes through whole countries and split
            those huge routes into digestible segments for a multi-day trip.
            Users who use the Route Editor like to cycle through forests and
            trails. They go on shorter rides and like to plan by manually
            drawing a route through a forest without any official road going
            through it. This way they can load the GPX file into their Bike
            Computer Device and use it for navigation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even though the below Persona was not created for this project in
            particular, it showcases that we actively thought about our target
            audiences for each feature and platform.
          </p>

              class="rounded-none"
            />
            <figcaption class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
              Example Persona. At Bikemap, we found that personas helped new
              employees to get an initial understanding of our user base but we
              also found that as soon as we understood our main personas, we
              actually never really used the assets in our conversations and
              presentations. So please keep in mind when reviewing this, that we
              actively decided to not put too much effort in designing and
              customizing them.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            With the first iteration of our web app, we targeted users who plan
            longer tours and need a bit more overview, screen space and control
            than our mobile apps can provide.
          </p>
          <p>
            The overall user flow would look like this: <br />

            A user gets inspired to do a longer cycling trip, the inspiration
            could come from anywhere: A friend, a blog, our content or even
            competitor content. They would then plan for a general location and
            time and use our web app to make their plan more concrete. When done
            with planning, they would save the route and use their mobile
            devices or other Bike Computers to navigate it when they finally
            start their trip.

          <p>
            Examining the old AB Planner reveals distinctive elements. Notably,
            a top navigation bar stands out for its visual clash with the
            content beneath, exuding a more modern aesthetic than the tool
            itself. Positioned on the left, a substantial block hosts two input
            fields for address entry, while the right showcases a map centered
            on Frankfurt am Main. Three buttons, labeled “Bike Paths,”
            “Heatmap,” and “Bikemap Basic ▾,” grace the top right corner of the
            map. The chevron on the last button hints at a menu with additional
            options, encompassing various map styles. Activating the "Heatmap"
            button generates a visualization of the most frequented roads by
            Bikemap users, with the "Bike Paths" button highlighting cycling
            paths in red.
          </p>
          <p>
            The focus for the new web app centered on addressing specific
            issues:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The top navigation bar's excessive space usage without substantial
              utility required optimization.
            </li>
            <li>
              The "Search for routes in…" input field's potential to cause
              confusion by diverting users away from the planner tool.
            </li>
            <li>The dated UI colors demanded a refresh.</li>
            <li>
              The lack of control over map styles, preventing customization or
              updates, needed attention.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>The Legacy Route Editor</h3>

          </figure>

          <p>
            Now, shifting focus to the Route Editor – it's not as seasoned as
            the AB Planner, boasting a more modern UI. The map flaunts muted
            colors, lending a cleaner overall appearance. Positioned on the left
            is a vertical row of buttons, each serving multiple functions: a
            geolocate button to center the map on the device's location, toggles
            for generating routes along roads or drawing manually, an eraser,
            options to return to the origin, reverse the route, undo and redo
            actions, and a button for adding Points-of-Interest. Adjacent to
            these buttons, there's an input field facilitating movement of the
            map view to any global location. At the bottom left, zoom, rotate,
            and full-screen buttons wrap up the toolset.
          </p>

          <p>
            The center of attention is the map. Crafting a route involves a
            simple click on map locations. This feature shines, especially when
            planning a trail ride in nature, far from the beaten path. Just zoom
            in, drop points manually, and you're good to go.
          </p>

            <li>
              The input field – it's missing the magic of turning into a
              waypoint, just relocating the map to the entered spot.
            </li>
            <li>Editor map styles – they're ours, and they're staying put.</li>
            <li>
              Those vertical buttons – not as obvious as we'd like them to be.
            </li>
            <li>
              Toggling between drawing mode and “follow streets” – easy for the
              experienced, but new users need a clearer grasp of the differences
              and use cases for each mode.

          </figure>

          <p>
            Let's delve into the initial designs exploration. We were
            essentially testing the waters, considering the feasibility of
            merging all features into one tool. On the left, you'll find the
            address input fields borrowed from the AB Planner. Directly below,
            there's the reverse route and a "back to origin" button inherited
            from the Route Editor. Additionally, a plus button allows users to
            add more waypoints to the route. Now, the noteworthy addition – the
            routing profile, or as labeled, "Routing Options." This feature
            assists users in customizing their route generation based on
            preferences and constraints. For instance, road cyclists may want to
            steer clear of gravel, parents might prefer routes with minimal
            traffic, and commuters may opt for the fastest route.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <h3>Stats Section</h3>
          <p>
            The Stats section provides data about the route, including distance,
            ETAs, average speed, and elevation data. Essentially, it functions
            as a fitness tracker for biking adventures.
          </p>

          <h3>Interesting Places Along the Way</h3>
          <p>
            This section presents a list of Points of Interest near the planned
            route. Some users expressed difficulties in finding interesting
            spots between their starting point and destination. They had diverse
            needs, ranging from including supermarkets or water sources for
            hydration to seeking inspiration for scenic detours, food options,
            and accommodations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, there's the "Search Place or Address" input – a minor typo
            slipped through. It was adopted from the Route Editor, but after
            realizing its limited utility, we decided to remove it. Users
            generally preferred using the waypoint input fields for place
            searches, anticipating the map to respond accordingly. Simple and
            efficient.

          <h2>Testing and Validation</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>We tested every design iteration with internal users</li>
            <li>Some designs were tested external users</li>
            <li>
              We used “Maze” to test our prototypes with others. The tool helped
              us to understand the paths our users would take, moments where
              they would get stuck and we would even see how long it would take
              them to complete a task.
            </li>
            <li>
              We had a beta phase in which users could use the old AB Planner
              and the new Web App in parallel before we would sunset the old
              route planner
            </li>
            <li>
              We found in our early prototypes that people really appreciated
              the idea of seeing points of interests along the route. We also
              found that it would be a bigger effort to implement. As a product
              manager, I had to remove it from the project scope since it was
              not essential to the core functionality of the tool and the
              original vision was to become independent from third party APIs.
            </li>
            <li>
              We found that users like to see the stats of their route but the
              would not open the accordion to see the data if it’s minimized on
              default.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some features like reordering the waypoints, deleting and changing
              the routing from “Follow Streets” to “Beeline” and back were only
              visible when users would hover over or click on certain elements
              on the interface. Users were able to intuitively discover those
              features when they were presented with the related task.

          <h2>Implementation and Development Journey</h2>
          <p>
            Given the extensive scope of the overall project and commitments
            from both backend and frontend development teams, I strategically
            divided this initiative into several epics:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Initial Epic - Web App Setup: </strong> <br />
              The first epic aimed to establish the development of the web app
              under a new domain (<a href="web.bikemap.net">web.bikemap.net</a
              >), incorporating a frontend component library and necessary
              technical groundwork. We iteratively collaborated between design
              and development for the component library, identifying, defining,
              and implementing components with thorough checks and approvals.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legacy AB Planner Reconstruction:</strong> <br />
              Another epic focused on rebuilding the legacy AB Planner without
              introducing new features. This was a vital step as the legacy AB
              Planner had significant dependencies on external services. To
              swiftly address this, we chose to eliminate these dependencies
              promptly. The initial web app iteration intentionally mirrored the
              existing AB Planner features.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Import Tool Transition:</strong> <br />
              A task within an ongoing epic involved moving the import tool,
              already in development, to the new design and the new web app
              domain. With a pre-established component library and user flows,
              this transition was seamless.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AB Planner Replacement:</strong> <br />
              An epic centered on replacing the legacy AB Planner with the new
              web app. This move was crucial, not only for introducing new
              editing capabilities but also for ensuring that newly created
              routes could be re-edited within the new tool. The transition also
              addressed the confusion caused by the previous system, where
              routes could only be re-edited using the Route Editor.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Routing Profiles Addition - A Quick Win:</strong> <br />
              A "quick win" epic aimed at adding routing profiles to the new web
              app. This was strategically important for enticing users to opt
              for a premium subscription. We recognized the value of providing
              users with routing profiles tailored to their preferences and
              constraints, such as the road bike profile.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Route Detail Page Migration:</strong> <br />
              An epic involved moving our "Route Detail" pages to the new web
              app. This streamlining process aimed to simplify user
              interactions, enabling them to edit metadata directly on the route
              detail view, eliminating the need to access a separate editor.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Capability Migration and Legacy Editor Shutdown:</strong>
              <br />
              With the saving process streamlined, subsequent epics involved
              migrating capabilities, like drawing routes by hand, from the
              legacy Route Editor to the new web app. The ultimate goal was to
              phase out the old Editor.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            The overarching vision for this initiative was to empower faster
            innovation without reliance on external providers.

          <h3>Web App Release and User Engagement</h3>
          <p>
            My tenure at Bikemap concluded with the successful launch of the
            initial version of the Web App. The legacy AB Planner remains
            operational, and you can explore the new web app firsthand at
            <a href="https://web.bikemap.net/plan"
              >https://web.bikemap.net/plan</a
            >. The user response was positive, underscoring the engagement of
            our user base with the route editor. Accidentally turning off the
            legacy editor and AB Planner revealed the depth of user involvement,
            reinforcing my commitment to rigorously test features transitioning
            to the new web app, ensuring a seamless experience for our dedicated
            users.
          </p>
          <h3>User Retention and Usage Patterns</h3>
          <p>
            Despite the significant changes, overall usage metrics remained
            consistent, aligning with our primary goal of retaining users
            throughout the transition. We successfully eliminated almost all
            dependencies on third-party providers, with only the route detail
            pages, including map previews, still utilizing them—a challenge
            addressed in the subsequent epic.
          </p>
          <h3>Enhanced User Insights through Data</h3>
          <p>
            Implementation of additional events will provide valuable insights
            into user behavior, enhancing Bikemap’s ability to comprehend
            general usage patterns. This newfound understanding enables Bikemap
            to track various aspects, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              User Engagement Metrics:
              <ul>
                <li>Daily and Monthly Active Users (DAU and MAU)</li>
                <li>Session duration</li>
                <li>Number of routes created</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Retention Metrics:
              <ul>
                <li>Churn rate</li>
                <li>Retention rate</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Conversion Metrics:
              <ul>
                <li>Premium conversion</li>
                <li>Sign-ups</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>In-Depth Feature Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            Furthermore, the implemented events facilitated detailed feature
            analysis, allowing Bikemap to track user interactions, such as the
            number of users planning routes without saving, identifying points
            of process abandonment, user authentication status, preferred
            routing profiles, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            This comprehensive data-driven approach empowered Bikemap to make
            informed decisions, address user needs proactively, and continuously
            enhance the web app to align with user expectations and preferences.

          <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
          <h3>Navigating Resource Constraints</h3>
          <p>
            The rapid progress of our initiative faced hurdles due to a busy
            backend team. Navigating around this constraint, I strategically
            determined tasks that could proceed independently and judiciously
            timed their integration with the backend team. This adaptive
            approach ensured optimal resource utilization and allowed the
            backend team to focus on critical projects.
          </p>

          <h3>Qualitative Decision Making Amid Data Gaps</h3>
          <p>
            Lack of robust user behavior tracking posed a challenge in
            prioritizing features. Decisions were largely based on qualitative
            user insights and stakeholder discussions, demanding a careful
            allocation of time and effort. While the outcome was satisfactory,
            the process underscored the need for more data-driven insights. In
            hindsight, accelerating the project timeline to gather more data and
            refine insights earlier would have been beneficial.
          </p>

          <h3>Communicating Value Amidst Technical Focus</h3>
          <p>
            In planning and negotiations, emphasis centered on the primary
            objective: eliminating costs and dependencies on third-party service
            providers. While stakeholders acknowledged the importance of this
            endeavor, I observed a subdued enthusiasm to propel the initiative
            forward. This highlighted the necessity for a more compelling
            communication strategy, elucidating the advantages at each step and
            epic. Ensuring alignment between technical milestones and broader
            organizational goals is crucial for sustained momentum.
          </p>

          <h3>Unexplored Tracking Metrics</h3>
          <p>
            Capacity constraints limited the implementation of comprehensive
            tracking metrics throughout the initiative. Desired metrics
            included:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              User Satisfaction Metrics:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) for
                  the web app or specific features.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Route Planning Effectiveness Metrics:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Completion Rate: Percentage of planned routes successfully
                  executed by users.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Route Customization Rate: Tracking user modifications to
                  suggested routes.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Conversion Funnel Analysis:
              <ul>
                <li>Understanding user journey from planning to conversion.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Social Sharing Metrics:
              <ul>
                <li>Assessing the web app's social engagement and outreach.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The incorporation of these metrics would have provided a more
            comprehensive understanding of user satisfaction, route planning
            efficacy, and the overall impact of the initiative on user behavior.

          <h2>Future Roadmap</h2>
          <p>
            I can’t speak as a Bikemap employee anymore but I’m really excited
            participated in paving the way for faster development and innovation
            of the Bikemap Web products. If I could decide what was next, my
            personal roadmap would look somewhat like this:
          </p>
          <h3>Finish the unification as fast as possible</h3>
          <p>
            The next important step is to get rid of the duplicate tool
            situation, so I would team up with a web developer and another
            designer to talk to our frequent Route Editor users. I’d expect to
            find that the most important feature they will need from the Editor
            is the manual drawing tool. I would then work on finding a way to
            include this tool into the new web app an a way that is easily
            discoverable and easy to understand for new users. We already have
            some design drafts and some vision designs for this so we could even
            directly test our vision with our super users.
          </p>
          <h3>Support Bikepackers</h3>
          <p>
            We had a strong signal in our user base to support multi day trips
            but we struggled to address this need because there were too many
            tools and our external providers were slowing us down. I personally
            see that addressing this user need could open up our user base for
            hardcore bikepackers. We already were able to generate longer routes
            (e.g. through the whole USA) than our competition, enabling users to
            make those routes more digestible and support their multi day trip
            planning could increase our user base and open up a lot of
            opportunities for monetization.
          </p>

          <h3>Route Generator</h3>
          <p>
            Me and Sebi, our lead Web Developer, always dreamt of utilizing the
            data we already have to figure out what kind of trips our users like
            to take. As a cyclist myself, I dream of a tool that takes my
            preferences and constraints and generate a route for me. I would
            love to create a route generator that takes data points like a
            preferred distance, general location, preferred duration, athletic
            intensity, scenic POIs and other factors and creates a route that
            users can navigate along. I would prefer that over scrolling through
            Komoot’s discovery for ages, trying to find a route that matches my
            needs.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The Bikemap Route Planner project successfully addressed user
            confusion, reduced external dependencies, and enhanced the overall
            user experience. Despite challenges in tracking certain metrics and
            navigating backend constraints, the initiative achieved its primary
            goals, setting the stage for Bikemap's continued innovation in the
            cycling app space.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am very glad to have worked on this project with a wonderful team.
            Especially our Designer Dominic, who always had my back and helped
            me to think out of my box, when I was stuck designing some
            components. He always brought a new perspective and helped to make
            the whole thing visually appealing. Another key person is Sebi, our
            lead Web developer. We collaborated very closely on this project and
            I really appreciate every time he took over when I got swamped
            extinguishing fires as a Product Manager.
