          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>
            We were able to create a holistic experience concept bringing
            together transmedia storytelling, interactive technology and real
            places. We also created a primising concept framework for
            explorative AR experiences and built an iOS prototype to showcase
            its application.

          <h2>Discovery and Design Iterations</h2>
          <h2>Design Thinking</h2>
          <p>
            From semantic analysis exercises over 10 plus 10s to ad hoc
            workshops we were our own facilitators throughout the whole process.
            We applied everything we learned in class in our autonomous project
            work. The Design Thinking methods helped us to design, ideate and
            make decisions throughout the whole project.
          </p>
          <h3>Research Wall</h3>
          <p>
            We used a physical research wall to align on our individual
            findings. This helped us to refer to specific things in discussions
            and remember why we made certain decisions earlier in the project.
          </p>
          <h3>Idea Portfolio and Feasibility Maps</h3>

          <p>
            We conducted mini workshops whenever we needed to solve design
            problems. We kept our idea portfolios on the Research Wall and later
            on digital, as you can see on the right. We also created personas,
            stakeholder maps, interaction tables and many more design artifacts.
          </p>

          <h3>Early and Regular Testings</h3>

          <p>
            We tried to use every opportunity to test our ideas before
            committing to them. We built paper prototypes to test our haptic
            experiences. We did a lot of white-boxing in Unity3D to test
            soundscapes and invited our university colleagues to give us
            feedback whenever possible. We also invited actors to act out our
            screenplays live on a stage to get a feeling of the mood in our
            story pieces.

          <h2>Design</h2>

          <h3>End to End Experience Design</h3>

          <p>
            Experience design is about the whole process and all senses. We
            tried to make every design decision for Raubkunst as intentional as
            possible. We picked a starting place for our experience that has a
            lot of cafes around so tourists could not only buy themselves a
            beverage when needed but also enjoy the small of fresh coffee beans
            when they start our experience. Our app used vibration for haptic
            feedback and we kept our sound design at a level that blended into
            the environment. We kept the on screen interactions on a minimal
            level so tourists can enjoy looking around in the real world and our
            app would also remind our users to take a break and enjoy some snack
            on a local store nearby.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <h3>Holistic Design</h3>

          <p>
            Raubkunst aims to serve tech savvy tourists but there are tons of
            humans who could be affected by our product as well. Our concept
            also took other people in consideration by avoiding overly crowded
            places depending of the time during the day and tracking check-ins
            on other services like Google and Facebook. We also wanted to
            support local businesses by reminding our users to take a break when
            they are close to a local store. Even our haptic objects were
            planned to be shared with other potential users as an invitation to
            "join the game".
          </p>

          <h3>Experience Framework</h3>
          <p>
            We created a conceptual framework called Memorama to help producing
            experiences that are location based and bring together fiction,
            historical and cultural knowledge about the location and utilize
            contemporary technology to communicate information. This Memorama
            framework serves as a guideline for a coherent experience. Our
            Memorama framework consists of three abstract spaces: Navigation
            Spaces, Discovery Spaces and the Home Space. This separation is
            necessary to be understandable and consistent. We utilize playful
            orientation in Navigation Spaces, tell the engaging story in
            Discovery Spaces and wind down in the Home Space.
          </p>

          <h3>Our 5E’s of Experience Design</h3>
          <p>
            We used the 5-E framework to include all senses into our experience.
            It also helped us to make the end to end experience more elegant.

          <h3>Why did design it for the phone?</h3>
          <p>
            We originally wanted Raubkunst to take place on wearable devices to
            fully immerse the user. But we decided to build our proof of concept
            on devices that are available to us now. Following examples
            from Pokemon Go and others, we used handheld devices. We limited
            ourselves to visual and sonic communication and aimed to reduce the
            time on screen to a minimum so users can fully experience the city.

          <p>
            We created our proof of concept using Unity3d and Vuforia. I
            partnered with a fellow UX Developer in our team to create the
            scenes and test different kinds of functionalities like image
            trigger recognition, different story triggers and object
            positioning.

          <h4>Story Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            Our goal was to bring users to real places and experience stories
            where they really happened. But to get users hooked we wanted to
            allow them to experience introduction elements anywhere so we
            prototyped this introduction installation which can be triggered
            anywhere.
          </p>

          <h4>Navigation Experience</h4>
          <p>
            Here you can watch how the navigation experience plays out in our
            prototype. We want people to spend as much time as possible looking
            at the real world and limit the time looking at the screen. This is
            why we only showed illustrated representations of real world
            elements to search. User would look around in the real world to find
            them and get the next visual hint. At this point we had no mechanism
            to check if users really found the thing we want them to find but we
            had multiple possible methods in mind: Checking for the GPS
            location, which would need a lot of testing because of the GPS
            inacuracies of up to 100m depending on device and service. And a
            visual check where users point their cameras to the object and our
            system visually confirms that they are at the right place. We
            prefered the latter method but this would be a lot of effort to
            implement for the MVP style prototype.

          <h2>Outcomes</h2>

          <h3>Learnings</h3>
          <p>
            This project helped me to dive deeper into coding in Unity3d and
            Interaction Design. Using Design Thinking methods in real situations
            was eye opening. Finally it also showed me the impact a good team
            chemistry can have on a project.
          </p>

          <h3>Public Presentations</h3>
          <p>
            We were proud to get the opportunity to present Raubkunst at the
            book fair 2018. We got a lot of encouraging feedback from visitors
            who used our prototype. I remember an older woman telling me
            that …this is the future.
          </p>

          <h3>Career Opportunities</h3>
          <p>
            Beyond lasting friendships and an exciting project, Raubkunst also
            gave all of us great job opportunities to start our careers. While I
            started at Cheil, a global creative agency, my team went on to start
            at interesting tech start ups and famous consultancies.
