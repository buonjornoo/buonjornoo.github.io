        <h1>Pause Mode for the Bikemap Mobile App</h1>
        <section>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In my role as a Product Manager at Bikemap, I undertook a
            significant project known as "Pause Mode." This project was
            particularly exciting, as it allowed me to leverage my background as
            both a Product Designer and Product Manager.
          </p>
          <h3>Key Points</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Recording cycling activity is a vital feature in the Bikemap app.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many cyclists take breaks during their rides for various reasons.
            </li>
            <li>
              The absence of a pause functionality in the Bikemap Bike Computer
              led to inaccuracies in ride recordings resulting in unrealistic
              performance data and visible GPS spikes on routes.
            </li>
            <li>We introduced a pause functionality to address this issue.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Project Timeline and Collaboration</h2>
          <p>
            The Pause Mode project took off in December 2022, with initial
            planning and pitching, and was successfully developed and shipped in
            February 2023. Throughout the project, I collaborated with a
            cross-functional team, including another designer, iOS and Android
            developers, backend developers, as well as marketing and business
            stakeholders.
          </p>
          <h3>My Contributions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I played a dual role as both a product manager and product
              designer.
            </li>
            <li>
              I pitched the project and convinced management stakeholders to
              make space for it in our roadmap.
            </li>
            <li>
              I initiated the project, creating initial designs and user flows.
            </li>
            <li>
              A colleague designer delivered the high-fidelity prototypes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Multiple iOS and Android developers were involved in building the
              feature.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Project Goals</h2>
          <p>The Pause Mode project had several key objectives:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Improve Data Quality<br />Enhance the accuracy of recorded routes,
              eliminating the need for users to include breaks in their
              recordings or split their routes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scope Management<br />Given time constraints, we aimed to keep the
              scope minimal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduce Support Workload<br />The project aimed to decrease the
              volume of support requests related to the missing pause feature.
            </li>
            <li>
              Boost User Satisfaction<br />Pause Mode was the most requested
              feature, and implementing it would improve user satisfaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Targeted Adoption<br />We expected an adoption rate of 20%,
              aligning with the anticipated user need.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Research and Discovery</h2>
          <p>
            Our journey began with user feedback. We closely monitored customer
            requests through a feedback tool called "Canny." These requests
            highlighted the significance of a pause feature. Guerilla user
            interviews and stakeholder discussions further validated the need
            for Pause Mode.
          </p>
          <h3>Key Insights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users wanted to pause their rides for various reasons, such as
              breaks for eating, resting, and exploring.
            </li>
            <li>
              Accurate performance data and battery conservation were
              significant concerns.
            </li>
            <li>
              Technical limitations posed challenges in implementing a proper
              pause mode.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Iteation and Design</h2>
          <p>
            The design phase involved brainstorming various solution scopes,
            including Pause Mode for Recording, Navigation, or both, and manual
            vs. auto pause options. We planned marketing efforts in parallel and
            determined the final scope based on prototypes and user feedback.

          <h2>Testing and Validation</h2>
          <p>
            The testing phase involved discussions with engineers and user flow
            validation using Overflow. Usability testing with high-fidelity
            prototypes in Figma helped refine the design. Adjustments were made
            based on user feedback and QA testing during the Release Candidate
            phase.

          <h2>Implementation and Development</h2>
          <p>
            Development was relatively straightforward, as the functionality was
            already present. However, iOS and Android teams had different
            schedules. The project was in collaboration with the marketing team
            to ensure users were informed about the upcoming feature.
          </p>
          <h3>Technical Constraints</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Limitations in backend capabilities for saving GPS timestamps.
            </li>
            <li>Mobile clients couldn't save multilegged routes to servers.</li>
            <li>Scope adjustments due to QA findings during development.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Results and Impact</h2>
          <p>
            The results of the Pause Mode project were promising. Users
            responded positively, even reinstalling the app after learning about
            the feature through the newsletter. Support requests related to the
            missing pause feature decreased significantly, and the adoption rate
            met expectations.
          </p>
          <h3>Key Outcomes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Positive user reactions and app installs.</li>
            <li>Reduced support requests.</li>
            <li>Adoption rate of around 20%.</li>
            <li>Plans to address additional issues in the future.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
          <p>
            Reflecting on the project, it highlighted the complexities behind
            seemingly simple features. As a Product Manager with a UX
            background, it required constant balancing between user-friendliness
            and timely release. Effective communication was crucial to convey
            the complexities to stakeholders.
          </p>
          <h3>Takeaways</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Shipping a feature with some limitations can be better than
              delaying perfection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Getting engineers excited about challenging features requires
              strong communication and C-Level support.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pausing Mode was an essential addition for users, even with its
              limitations.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            In summary, the Pause Mode project appeared straightforward on the
            surface but had underlying complexities. We successfully reduced the
            scope to deliver a working feature on time. The feature was
            well-received, and adoption rates aligned with expectations.
          </p>
