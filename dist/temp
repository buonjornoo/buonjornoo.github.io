          <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-2">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In the realm of cycling apps, Bikemap encountered a challenge with
            its web-based route planning tools. The "AB-Planner" and "Route
            Editor" offered similar functionalities, leading to user confusion.
            Additionally, both relied on external services, hindering
            innovation. The initiative to create a unified route planner began
            in Q3 2021 and evolved through my roles as both Product Designer and
            Product Manager.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Business and Innovation</h3>
          <p>
            The primary goal was to break free from an expensive service
            provider, facilitating faster innovation. Simultaneously, we aimed
            to streamline the user experience by offering a single, intuitive
            tool for route creation and editing.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">UX Enhancement</h3>
          <p>
            Reducing user confusion and aligning our web and mobile tools
            visually were key UX objectives. Our strategy involved focusing on
            commuters, addressing the legacy AB Planner's outdated appearance,
            and ensuring cross-platform consistency.

            Our research delved into technical constraints, user needs, and
            competitive analysis. Key insights included:

              <strong>Third-Party Dependencies:</strong> <br />
              External providers hindered quick innovation, limiting

          <p>
            We know that only a small, but very engaged, part of our user base
            is using the Web Route Planners frequently. Most of them use the
            Route Editor since the legacy AB Planner has much more options on
            the mobile app than the Web Version. Generally speaking, we found
            that most users who use the legacy AB Planner, are people who enjoy
            long tours. Some even plan routes through whole countries and split
            those huge routes into digestible segments for a multi-day trip.
            Users who use the Route Editor like to cycle through forests and
            trails. They go on shorter rides and like to plan by manually
            drawing a route through a forest without any official road going
            through it. This way they can load the GPX file into their Bike
            Computer Device and use it for navigation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even though the below Persona was not created for this project in
            particular, it showcases that we actively thought about our target
            audiences for each feature and platform.

          <figure class="flex flex-col items-center my-8">
            <!-- Image -->
            <img
              src="/img/Persona Example.png"
              alt="Image of an exemplary Persona document"
              class="max-w-3xl rounded-none"
            />
            <figcaption class="text-gray-400 text-sm max-w-3xl">
              Example Persona. At Bikemap, we found that personas helped new
              employees to get an initial understanding of our user base but we
              also found that as soon as we understood our main personas, we
              actually never really used the assets in our conversations and
              presentations. So please keep in mind when reviewing this, that we
              actively decided to not put too much effort in designing and
              customizing them.

          </figure>
          <p>
            With the first iteration of our web app, we targeted users who plan
            longer tours and need a bit more overview, screen space and control
            than our mobile apps can provide.
          </p>
          <p>
            The overall user flow would look like this: <br />

            A user gets inspired to do a longer cycling trip, the inspiration
            could come from anywhere: A friend, a blog, our content or even
            competitor content. They would then plan for a general location and
            time and use our web app to make their plan more concrete. When done
            with planning, they would save the route and use their mobile
            devices or other Bike Computers to navigate it when they finally
            start their trip.
