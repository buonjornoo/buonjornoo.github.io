          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>
            Hi, I'm Jorne. In my dual roles as a UX Designer and Product
            Manager, I delve deep into the heart of problems, bridging the gap
            between technology, user needs, and business goals. But let's talk
            about you. Your challenges, your vision, and how we can collaborate
            to craft meaningful, impactful solutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my pursuit of pragmatic solutions, I've had the privilege of
            shaping significant features like Bikemap's Pause Mode and unifying
            disparate web tools into a singular, user-friendly app. My journey
            at KION exemplifies my approach - where a proposed robot became a
            simple, cost-saving scanner, thanks to targeted user research.
          </p>

          <p>
            My technical creativity also flourished during my Master's thesis,
            where I blended storytelling with augmented reality to create an
            immersive exploration of Frankfurt, turning the city itself into a
            canvas for hidden art and narratives.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm driven by a vision to create humane technology, aspiring to join
            forces with a company that not only talks the talk but walks the
            walk towards understanding its customers and making a tangible
            difference. My goal? To craft experiences that not only meet needs
            but also bring smiles to users' faces.
          </p>

          <p>
            While I'm a UX and product management professional, my background in
            Sound and Music Production, combined with a Masterâ€™s in Leadership
            in the Creative Industries, has shaped my diverse skill set. From
            Service Design to Coding in Unity3D, my journey is one of continuous
            learning and application.
          </p>

          <p>
            Away from the screen, I'm testing my limits, be it on rugby fields,
            lifting weights, or cycling endurance rides over 100km. These
            activities not only challenge me physically but also keep me
            grounded and connected to the real world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Are you in search of a partner to navigate the intricacies of user
            experience and product management? Let's start a conversation on
