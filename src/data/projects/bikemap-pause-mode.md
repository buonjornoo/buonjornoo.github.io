## Introduction

As Product Manager at Bikemap, I undertook the "Pause Mode" project — the most requested feature from our users. The absence of pause functionality led to inaccuracies in ride recordings, resulting in unrealistic performance data and visible GPS spikes on routes.

## Timeline & Team

Kicked off in December 2022 with planning and pitching. Successfully shipped in February 2023. Collaborated with designers, iOS/Android developers, backend developers, and business stakeholders.

## Goals

- Improve recorded route data quality
- Keep scope minimal given time constraints
- Reduce support requests about missing pause
- Boost user satisfaction (most requested feature)
- Target 20% adoption rate

## Research

Monitored customer requests through Canny. Guerilla user interviews and stakeholder discussions validated the need. Users wanted to pause for eating, resting, and exploring. Accurate performance data and battery conservation were key concerns.

## Design Iteration

## Testing

Validated user flows using Overflow. Usability testing with high-fidelity Figma prototypes refined the design. Adjustments based on feedback: refined copywriting, extended notification timeout, deferred auto-pause for roadmap.

## Results

- Positive user reactions and app reinstalls
- Significant decrease in support requests
- ~20% adoption rate as expected
- Plans for auto-pause in future iterations

## Lessons Learned

Shipping with some limitations can be better than delaying perfection. Getting engineers excited about challenging features requires strong communication and C-Level support. The seemingly simple feature hid underlying complexities.
