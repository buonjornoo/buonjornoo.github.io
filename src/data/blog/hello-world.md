## Welcome

This is the first post on my new website. I rebuilt it from scratch with a modern teletext aesthetic — inspired by the BBC Ceefax pages I never got to experience first-hand, but find endlessly charming.

## Why Teletext?

There's something beautiful about constraints. Teletext had 8 colors, a 40-column grid, and blocky graphics. Yet people made art, news services, and even games with it.

I wanted my portfolio to feel the same way — distinctive, focused, and a little playful.

## What's Next

I'll be writing about UX design, product management, and the occasional technical deep-dive. Stay tuned.
