## About Me

Hi, I'm Jorne. In my dual roles as a UX Designer and Product Manager, I bridge the gap between technology, user needs, and business goals.

I've shaped significant features like Bikemap's Pause Mode and unified disparate web tools into a singular, user-friendly app. At KION, a proposed robot became a simple, cost-saving scanner — thanks to targeted user research.

My Master's thesis blended storytelling with augmented reality to create an immersive exploration of Frankfurt, turning the city into a canvas for hidden art and narratives.

I'm driven by a vision to create humane technology — crafting experiences that not only meet needs but bring smiles to users' faces.

Away from the screen, I'm on rugby fields, lifting weights, or cycling endurance rides over 100km.
