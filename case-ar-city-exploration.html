                We were able to create a holistic experience concept bringing
                together transmedia storytelling, interactive technology and
                real places. We also created a primising concept framework for
                explorative AR experiences and built an iOS prototype to
                showcase its application.

              <p>
                From semantic analysis exercises over 10 plus 10s to ad hoc
                workshops we were our own facilitators throughout the whole
                process. We applied everything we learned in class in our
                autonomous project work. The Design Thinking methods helped us
                to design, ideate and make decisions throughout the whole
                project.

              <h4>Research Wall</h4>
              <p>
                We used a physical research wall to align on our individual
                findings. This helped us to refer to specific things in
                discussions and remember why we made certain decisions earlier
                in the project.

                We conducted mini workshops whenever we needed to solve design
                problems. We kept our idea portfolios on the Research Wall and
                later on digital, as you can see on the right. We also created
                personas, stakeholder maps, interaction tables and many more
                design artifacts.

              <p>
                We tried to use every opportunity to test our ideas before
                committing to them. We built paper prototypes to test our haptic
                experiences. We did a lot of white-boxing in Unity3D to test
                soundscapes and invited our university colleagues to give us
                feedback whenever possible. We also invited actors to act out
                our screenplays live on a stage to get a feeling of the mood in
                our story pieces.

              <h3>End to End Experience Design</h3>
              <p>
                Experience design is about the whole process and all senses. We
                tried to make every design decision for Raubkunst as intentional
                as possible. We picked a starting place for our experience that
                has a lot of cafes around so tourists could not only buy
                themselves a beverage when needed but also enjoy the small of
                fresh coffee beans when they start our experience. Our app used
                vibration for haptic feedback and we kept our sound design at a
                level that blended into the environment. We kept the on screen
                interactions on a minimal level so tourists can enjoy looking
                around in the real world and our app would also remind our users
                to take a break and enjoy some snack on a local store nearby.

                Raubkunst aims to serve tech savvy tourists but there are tons
                of humans who could be affected by our product as well. Our
                concept also took other people in consideration by avoiding
                overly crowded places depending of the time during the day and
                tracking check-ins on other services like Google and Facebook.
                We also wanted to support local businesses by reminding our
                users to take a break when they are close to a local store. Even
                our haptic objects were planned to be shared with other
                potential users as an invitation to "join the game".

                We created a conceptual framework called <em>Memorama</em> to
                help producing experiences that are location based and bring
                together fiction, historical and cultural knowledge about the
                location and utilise contempo- rary technology to communicate
                information. This Memorama framework serves as a guideline for a
                coherent experience. Our Memorama framework consists of three
                abstract spaces: Navigation Spaces, Discovery Spaces and the
                Home Space. This separation is necessary to be understandable
                and consistent. We utilize playful orientation in Navigation
                Spaces, tell the engaging story in Discovery Spaces and wind
                down in the Home Space.

                We originally wanted <em>Raubkunst</em> to take place on
                wearable devices to fully immerse the user. But we decided to
                build our proof of concept on devices that are available to us
                <b>now</b>. Following examples from <em>Pokemon Go</em> and
                others, we used handheld devices. We limited ourselves to visual
                and sonic communication and aimed to reduce the time on screen
                to a minimum so users can fully experience the city.

                We created our proof of concept using Unity3d and Vuforia. I
                partnered with a fellow UX Developer in our team to create the
                scenes and test different kinds of functionalities like image
                trigger recognition, different story triggers and object
                positioning.

              <p>
                This project helped me to dive deeper into coding in Unity3d and
                Interaction Design. Using Design Thinking methods in real
                situations was eye opening. Finally it also showed me the impact
                a good team chemistry can have on a project.

                We were proud to get the opportunity to present Raubkunst at the
                book fair 2018. We got a lot of encouraging feedback from
                visitors who used our prototype. I remember an older woman
                telling me that <em>â€¦this is the future</em>.

                Beyond lasting friendships and an exciting project, Raubkunst
                also gave all of us great job opportunities to start our
                careers. While I started at Cheil, a global creative agency, my
                team went on to start at interesting tech start ups and famous
